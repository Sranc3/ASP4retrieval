# Attentive-Snippet-Prompting-for-video-retrieval
### Demo for ASP ###
This is the implementation for the paper Attentive Snippet Prompting for Video Retrieval.

ASP is a video-text retreval pardigm based on [CLIP (ViT-B)](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) and [CLIP4Clip (ViT-B)](https://github.com/ArrowLuo/CLIP4Clip). We find that, since a video contains rich and complex content, different annotators often give divsersified texts to desribe this video, As shown below, each ground-truth text may just refer to a video snippet, and a video may contain different snippets for different text queries.
